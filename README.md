# Assignment-5

This is my fifth assignment in the Programming Hero Next Level Web Development course platform. I am very excited to share and describe my project with you.

This is a blogging and portfolio platform management application that consists of three collections: One is the blog collection, another project collection and the other message collection. The first and the second one involve creating, fetching, updating and deleting operations of blogs and projects. The third one handles sending and viewing user messages.

Here is the description of how I have set up my project environment, the technologies I have used, how to run and inspect the project.
